# m_constraint


### Tooling to handle constraints for maya transforms using matrix nodes.

##### traditionally constraint objects in maya lock off the ability to transform the object
##### this stops animators from adding extra motion ontop of the inherited motion
##### to add / modify / extend animation a bake down process is required.
##### this reduces flexibility and 
####
####
### Goals:
##### a full set of tools to create / remove / bake constraints from a
##### matrix input -> the parent transform offset
